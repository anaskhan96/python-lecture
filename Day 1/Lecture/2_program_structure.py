# program structure
# - no entry function - no main
# - a statement has to be on a single line
# - to have a statement on more than one line
#		- use delimiters marking the beginning and the end
#		- cheat the compiler; escape the new line
# - to have multiple statements on a single line
#		- use ; as a separator
# - case sensitive
# - indentation plays major role
# - all the lines in the beginning should start from the first col
# - not a free format source code language
# - any expr is a statement
# - otherway is not necessarily true
# - model of execution
#		checks the program for syntax errors
#		does not start executing even if there is a single error
